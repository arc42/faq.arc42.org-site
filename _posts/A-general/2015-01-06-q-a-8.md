The content of the arc42 template is maintained in AsciiDoc format in a
[public Github repository]() - we try to follow a _single-source_ approach
(but currently don't succeed fully!)

* We maintain one version for every supported language (currently German and English). We call those the `Golden-Master`, in the [arc42-template](https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template/) repository. `Golden-Master` versions contain both the template content plus the essential help information (content, motivation and form).
* From `Golden-Master` we generate a multitude of output formats by Gradle build scripts, using a number of open source tools. One generated format is Microsoft&tm; "docx".
This generator is maintained in its own project ([arc42-generator](https://github.com/arc42/arc42-generator/)),
which includes the arc42-template as a git submodule.
* Some formats are maintained manually, as the automatic generation is either too bad or would be too much effort to implement:
  * This FAQ website and the [arc42-documentation-site](http://docs.arc42.org) are
maintained manually... as we have no means of automatically
  * Enterprise-Architect model templates are maintained within EA.
  * Our Leanpub books are maintained manually
