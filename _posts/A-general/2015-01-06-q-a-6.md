* Simon Brown's [SA4D/C4](http://simonbrown.je/#softwarearchitecture) model.
You find a brief introduction in one of his [blog posts](https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2014/10/simple-sketches-for-diagramming-your-software-architecture/)
* [The View-Model](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0046XS3RO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
of Paul Clements et. al from the Software Engineering Institute.
From our point of view, their approach is _very_ heavyweight and can become quite
formal when applied to real-world projects.
* In case your organization has created its own "Software Architecture Documentation Template": It should contain quality requirements, a scope/context section and
information about building blocks and crosscutting concepts. If it does, you're pretty
close to arc42 anyway...
