Yes, it surely does. arc42 is supposed to be used "on demand" - you provide only
the type or amount of information required for your specific documentation purpose.

This interpretation fits nicely with lean and agile approaches - where you shall
avoid _waste_ and focus on fulfilling requirements... arc42 helps you to fulfill
your documentation requirements easily in a pre-structured and well-thought-out way.
