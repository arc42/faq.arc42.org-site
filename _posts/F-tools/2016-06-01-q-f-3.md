**Short answer**: Never (!) copy/paste code into your documentation - as it will be outdated before you hit the save key.

### Longer answer (for AsciiDoc):

You can include code fragments be the following scheme:

{% highlight asciidoc %}

    [source,groovy]
    ----
    include::{sourcedir}/Sample.groovy[lines=1;7..-1]
    ----

{% endhighlight %}

Instead of explicitely giving the line numbers in the include statements, you can annotate the corresponding source files with comment tags, as shown in the following example:

{% highlight java %}
    class Sample {
       // tag::helloMethod[]
       String hello() {
         'Asciidoc rules!'
       }
       // end::helloMethod[]
     }
{% endhighlight %}

and then reference this snippet in your documentation as follows:

{% highlight asciidoc %}
    [source,groovy]
    ----
    include::Sample.groovy[tags=helloMethod]
    ----
{% endhighlight %}
