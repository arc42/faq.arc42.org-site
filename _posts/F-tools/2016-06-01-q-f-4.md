Most modeling tools lack _out-of-the-box_ arc42 support,
you have to create your desired arc42 (sub-)structures
by yourself.

arc42 does provide an empty arc42-structured model
for Sparx Enterprise Architect(R), although not very
elaborated.

We advice to restrict the use of modeling tools to the
pure graphical part of architecture documentation,
leave text and tables to other tools that are more
suited for these kinds of information.
In this case, create the following arc42-sections in
your modeling tool:

* Context view
* Building block view
* Runtime view
* Deployment view
* Crosscutting concepts
