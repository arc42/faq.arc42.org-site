Yes, of course. See [Question A-2 (arc42 License)](/questions/A-2).

### Completely free to use and modify

You may modify the structure of the template, re-create it in any tool of
your choice or even rename it for your own purpose
(one of our clients called it SAT42, what we really enjoyed.)

To be fair, you should reference Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka
as creators of arc42 in case you use or modify the template...

### If you distribute, you need to respect the CC license
