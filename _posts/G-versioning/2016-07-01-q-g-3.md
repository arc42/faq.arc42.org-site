Although some tool vendors argue differently, recognizing the _meaning_
of differences between diagrams requires human intelligence:
I (Gernot) have not yet found any automatism supporting meaningful _diff_
of diagrams or images. In my opinion somebody needs to care for
new versions of diagrams.

It can help (automatically) include the modification date in a diagram (some modeling tools support this feature).

In the diagram below you find an example - version notes
are shown in the upper left corner.
