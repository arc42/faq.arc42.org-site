Yes, of course!. At best with the same strategy, processes and tools you use for your source code.

(Gernot's opinion): If it's not under version control, it does not exist (with the sole exception of well-managed wiki systems, that easily allow you to read older versions of documents.)

If you cannot use your version control system for your
(architecture) documentation, see [Question G-2](#q-G-2).
