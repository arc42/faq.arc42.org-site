The building block view should be a hierarchical explanation of your source code,
of the static (code) structure of your system. It contains blackboxes of various level-of-detail.

It can be very understandable to make your _important_ blackboxes part of your topmost refinement level,
called _level-1_ in arc42.

If your important blackbox is something quite small which
you don't want to explicitly contain in level-1, then you could
contain it in any refinement level - and mark it in its
containing whitebox in color or by other visual means:
Draw it larger than others, attach a graphical label/icon to it,
give it a colored border - anything to let it stand out.
Be pragmatic!
