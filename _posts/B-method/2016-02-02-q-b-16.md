Some tips for appropriate (_economical_ or _thrifty_) documentation:

* Less (shorter) documentation can be often read and digested in shorter time
(but beware of _overly cryptic_ brevity, so no Perl, APG or regular expressions).
* Less documentation implies fewer future changes or modifications.
* Explicitly decide what kind and amount of documentation is appropriate, and
with what level of detail.
* Differentiate between short-lived, volatile documentation (i.e. flipcharts for
  your project work) and long-lived _system_ documentation. See [tip V-6]{#tip-v-6}
* Dare to leave gaps: Deliberately leave certain parts of your (arc42) documentation empty.
Especially within arc42-section 8 (crosscutting concepts) you can often remove numerous subsections
that might not be relevant for your specific system.
