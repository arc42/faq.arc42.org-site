You can find an extensive explanation in our [docs (section 3, business and technical context)](http://docs.arc42.org/tips/3-10/)

A short summary:

* The _business_ context concentrates an pure business or domain interactions of
the system with its environment. You will often find _domain_ terms for external
interfaces, no technology.
* The _technical_ context shows hardware, technical infrastructure, technical protocols,
network details or similar information concerning the system and its (technical)
environment.

Especially in embedded or hardware-related systems, the technical context is an
important perspective of architectural development.

Especially in information or decision-support (data-warehouse etc) systems,
the technical context is often omitted.

>Personal experience (from Gernot): For information system, defer the technical
information to the deployment view (arc42 section 7) instead of creating
and maintaining a technical context. I survived many years and many commercial
projects without ever creating a technical context - although you should never
(!) start developing systems without having a clear understanding of your
business context.
